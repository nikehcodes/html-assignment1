                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Registered Nurse with over two years of experience in healthcare. I had my diploma in
                        Nursing from Ogun
                        state college of nursing science and I'm currently studying to get my degree in nuring from
                        Ahmadu Bello
                        University. I have been in tech for over 2 years. Although, it hasnt been easy combining both
                        Nursing and
                        tech, I'm happy to be enrolled
                        in Alt school cloud engineering track.

                    <h2>Reason For Joining Alt School</h2>
                    <p> Alt school is one of the leading and top school in Africa. </p>
                    <p>I knew about Alt school from Twitter, I was not really sure about it, but I started seeing posts
                        from
                        Alumni about how it changed their lives and instilled foundations which they are able to use to
                        be sucessful their
                        fields.
                        I choose Cloud Engineering because I have basic knowledge in frontend through self learning
                        and would love to go into something I havent tried learning before. </p>

                        <h2>My goals</h2>
                        <p> As a registered nurse, I have seen there is a gap between Healthcare and Technology. I
                            attended a tech
                            conference recently and three people pitched,suprising all three were centred on healthcare.
                        </p>
                        <p>Why is there a gap? How do we bridge this gap?</p>
                        <p>Here are my goals:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Network with industry professionals and peers.</li>
                            <li>Develop Skills in software engineering</li>
                            <li>Incorporate my knowledge of healthcare with technology</li>
                            <li>Join open source contributions</li>
                        </ul>
